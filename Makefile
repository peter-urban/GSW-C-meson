# --- NOTES ---:
# (1) The default CC variable is defined in the TOOLS.gcc file (make) / Tools.ini (nmake) file.
#     use (n)make CC=compiler_command_of_choice to override the default compiler.
# (2) On windows the default CC variable is cl with the option /TP. This causes the project to be compiled
#     as C++ code on windows. This is necessary because msvc does not support C99 style complex numbers.
#     See also notes in TOOLS.ini.
